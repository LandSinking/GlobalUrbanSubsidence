# Global Urban Subsidence


Urban land subsidence occurs worldwide, yet a global-scale assessment based on a consistent methodology is still absent, hindering the implementation of targeted adaption or mitigation measures. Using satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data (2014-2023), we produced self-consistent, high-spatial-resolution relative local land subsidence maps for global major cities. The results of this study are crucial for addressing the potential hazards posed by urban subsidence worldwide.


This repository consists of data and codes that execute the SBAS InSAR Workflow and generate all the figures.

The land subsidence velocities, InSAR coherence, the standard deviation of velocities, and geographic locations of reference points for all 465 cities in this study can be visualized at [GUS Portal](https://ee-pkurelab.projects.earthengine.app/view/gus). Velocity maps are publicly released at [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30786143).

Analysis results from this repository have been submitted to ***Nature Cities*** and are currently under major revision. Feedback and collaboration are welcome!
