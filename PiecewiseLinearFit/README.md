  Package "parfor_progressbar" is required to show a graphical progress indicator:   https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53773-parfor_progressbar

 
- Pvalue.py: python codes (based on [piecewise-regression](https://github.com/chasmani/piecewise-regression) package) for Davies' significance level test:
  <pre><code>Davies, R. B. Hypothesis testing when a nuisance parameter is present only under the alternative. Biometrika, 74(1), 33-43 (1987)</code></pre>
  The change was considered statistically significant when p-value < 0.05
